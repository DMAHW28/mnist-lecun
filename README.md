# MNIST Project - LeNet Architecture (LeCun)

## 👋 Project Description  
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the **LeNet-5** architecture, designed by **Yann LeCun**, to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset.  
The goal is to build a high-accuracy digit recognition model using deep learning techniques.

![LeNet5](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*1TI1aGBZ4dybR6__DI9dzA.png)

The model is based on the LeNet-5 architecture, which consists of the following layers:

1. **Input**: 28x28 grayscale images  
2. **C1 - Convolution** (6 filters 5x5, stride=1) → ReLU activation  
3. **S2 - Subsampling** (MaxPooling 2x2)  
4. **C3 - Convolution** (16 filters 5x5, stride=1) → ReLU activation  
5. **S4 - Subsampling** (MaxPooling 2x2)  
6. **C5 - Fully Connected** (120 neurons)  
7. **F6 - Fully Connected** (84 neurons)  
8. **Output Layer** (10 neurons, softmax for classification)

## 📊 Expected Results  
After training, the model is expected to achieve approximately **99%** accuracy on the test set.

| Metric         | Expected Value |
|----------------|----------------|
| Accuracy       | ~99%             |
| Loss           | < 0.05            |
| Training Time  | ~5 minutes (CPU)  |
